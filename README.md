## Keomony Khun

After raising a child, I rediscovered my passion for technology and building great products. I have completed a course at Makers Academy, a bootcamp, in which I was trained to develop best practices in software craftsmanship. I am looking for an environment which allows me to contribute and grow as an individual and as a developer.

## Skills

#### I can write maintainable code

I have learnt skills like behaviour driven development, test driven development and object oriented programming, to produce readable and maintainable code. I developed these skills in Makers Academy and can be seen in my projects.

#### Technical Communication

I am an effective communicator of technical ideas and concepts with my peers. At makers Academy I pair programmed everyday to collaboratively come up with solutions for problems.

I have built training materials and manuals for IT applications during my work as an IT Administrator at CWCC(Cambodian Women's Crisis Center) as well as a developer in all previous working places.

#### I can facilitate idea sharing

I can organize sessions and facilitate conversations while giving everyone a chance to speak and express themselves.  I organized workshops and meetings during my work at CCHR and CICP in Cambodia.

#### I am Self Driven

I am self driven and constantly strive to improve myself and learn new skills. I am learning to write good code and getting myself back to work with a course in Makers Academy. I also started and managed one of the first online shops in Cambodia.
