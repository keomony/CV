## Keomony Khun

I am a full stack developer specializing in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and jQuery. I did a Computer Science Degree and worked as a web developer in various organizations in Cambodia. I am passionate about technology and love solving problems. I decided to get back to work after 5 years of parenting. To begin with, I started teaching myself Ruby.

In November 2016, I enrolled in Makers Academy, Europe's leading developer Bootcamp, and the Bootcamp has been a fantastic experience for me. Firstly I am amazed at what I have learned and can use those skills to create web applications using Ruby and JavaScript. In addition, I learned many software-development-best practices, including Agile methodologies, XP values, and object-oriented design principles.

I am looking forward to joining a focused and driven team which emphasizes individual development and contributing to the community.

## Skills

#### I can write maintainable code

I have learnt skills like behaviour driven development, test driven development and object oriented programming, to produce readable and maintainable code. I developed these skills in Makers Academy and can be seen in my projects.

#### Technical Communication

I am an effective communicator of technical ideas and concepts with my peers. At makers Academy I pair programmed everyday to collaboratively come up with solutions for problems.

I have built training materials and manuals for IT applications during my work as an IT Administrator at CWCC(Cambodian Women's Crisis Center) as well as a developer in all previous working places.

#### I can facilitate idea sharing

I can organize sessions and facilitate conversations while giving everyone a chance to speak and express themselves.  I organized workshops and meetings during my work at CCHR(Cambodian Center for Human Rights) and CICP(Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace).

#### I am Self Driven

I am self driven and constantly strive to improve myself and learn new skills. I am learning to write good code and getting myself back to work with a course in Makers Academy. I also started and managed one of the first online shops in Cambodia.
